Lab 3
1. A five-digit number is entered through the keyboard. Write a program to obtain
the reversed number and to determine whether the original and reversed
numbers are equal or not.
2. Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles
of the triangle are entered through the keyboard.
A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.
3. Given the length and breadth of a rectangle, write a program to find whether the
area of the rectangle is greater than its perimeter.
For example, the area (length * breadth) of the rectangle with length = 5 and
breadth = 4 is greater than its perimeter (2*(length + breadth)).
4. A library charges a fine for every book returned late. For first 5 days, the fine is 50
cents per day, for 6-10 days fine is $1 per day and above 10 days fine is $5 per
day. If you return the book after 30 days your membership will be cancelled.
Write a program to accept the number of days the member is late to return the
book and display the fine or the appropriate message.
5. Use conditional operator to do the following:
a. find the greatest of the three numbers entered through the keyboard
b. determine whether a year entered through the keyboard is a leap year or
not
6. Write a C program that performs the following task once using a while loop once
using a for loop and once more using a do while loop:
• Prints the squares of 0 to 10 in reverse order, i.e. the output will be
100, 81, 64, 49, ……., 0.
